$ Killer Sudoko instance, by Andras Salamon
$ specify last index in array cage; cage[0,..] is first entry
letting lastdx be 25
$ [t,i1,j1,i2,j2,i3,j3,i4,j4] requires that
$ t = values[i1,j1] + values[i2,j2] + values[i3,j3] + values[i4,j4]
$ 0,0 is a dummy value that is ignored
$ would be better done with lists, if we had lists...
letting cage be
