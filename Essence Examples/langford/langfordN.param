$ Langford's number problem (CSP lib problem 24)
$
$ Arrange 2 sets of positive integers 1..k to a sequence,
$ such that, following the first occurence of an integer i, 
$ each subsequent occurrence of i, appears i+1 indices later
$ than the last. 
$ For example, for k=4, a solution would be 41312432
