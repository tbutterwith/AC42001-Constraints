given n : int
given num_entries : int
given values : matrix indexed by [int(1..num_entries)] of int(1..100)
given weights : matrix indexed by [int(1..num_entries)] of int(1..100)

find x : matrix indexed by [int(1..num_entries)] of bool
find z : int(0..10000)

$ This should be a parameter file


maximising z

such that
   z = sum i : int(1..num_entries) . x[i]*values[i],
   (sum i : int(1..num_entries) . x[i]*weights[i]  ) <= n
